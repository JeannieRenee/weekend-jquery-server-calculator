Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. Huge thanks to my peers in the Gaiman cohort for their unwavering support- I couldn't have done it without them. Hugs and love to my friends and family for being patient with me while I immersed myself in the software world and had little time for anything else.
